There are mainly two fuctions.

1.  user defined function : the user  defined function user perform

# How to install the Numpy

# What is NumPy?
# NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

# It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

# NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

# NumPy stands for Numerical Python.


# Which Language is NumPy written in?
# NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, 
# but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
